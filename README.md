🚀 Elevvo Customer Segmentation 📊
"A data-driven approach to understanding your customers" 📈

📖 Description
The Elevvo Customer Segmentation project is a Python script that uses machine learning to segment customers based on their characteristics. This project provides businesses with a data-driven way to understand their customer base, enabling them to tailor their marketing strategies. The script uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers and generates a visualization of the resulting segments.

This project uses popular Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, to load, manipulate, and visualize customer data.

✨ Features
Data Loading: Loads customer data from a CSV file.

Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning and preparation for modeling.

K-Means Clustering: Segments customers using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Model Evaluation: Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

Data Visualization: Creates and saves a plot visualizing the customer segments.

📁 Project Structure
The project's structure is simple and consists of the following files:

customer_segmentation.py: The main Python script containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

Data.csv: The dataset containing the customer information.

⚙️ How to Run
To run the Customer Segmentation analysis, follow these steps:

Setup
Clone the project repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Khanihub/Elevvo_Customer-Segmentation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd Elevvo_Customer-Segmentation
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Running the Script
Execute the main Python script from your terminal:

Bash

python customer_segmentation.py
After running, the script will generate a new file named customer_segments.png in the same directory, which contains the visualization of the customer clusters.
