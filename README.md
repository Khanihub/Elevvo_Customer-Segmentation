You are absolutely right\! My apologies for that mistake. I misidentified the file type. Thank you for the correction.

Based on the file being `customer_segmentation.py`, the project is a runnable Python script, not a Jupyter Notebook. Here is the fully corrected `README.md` with the proper instructions.

# 🚀 Elevvo Customer Segmentation 📊

**"A data-driven approach to understanding your customers"** 📈

-----

## 📖 Description

The **Elevvo Customer Segmentation** project is a Python script that uses machine learning to segment customers based on their characteristics. This project provides businesses with a data-driven way to understand their customer base, enabling them to tailor their marketing strategies. The script uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers and generates a visualization of the resulting segments.

This project uses popular Python libraries, including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**, to load, manipulate, and visualize customer data.

## ✨ Features

  * **Data Loading**: Loads customer data from a CSV file.
  * **Data Preprocessing**: Handles data cleaning and preparation for modeling.
  * **K-Means Clustering**: Segments customers using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
  * **Model Evaluation**: Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
  * **Data Visualization**: Creates and saves a plot visualizing the customer segments.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project's structure is simple and consists of the following files:

  * `customer_segmentation.py`: The main Python script containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
  * `Data.csv`: The dataset containing the customer information.

## ⚙️ How to Run

To run the Customer Segmentation analysis, follow these steps:

### Setup

1.  **Clone the project repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Khanihub/Elevvo_Customer-Segmentation.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Elevvo_Customer-Segmentation
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

### Running the Script

1.  **Execute the main Python script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation.py
    ```
2.  After running, the script will generate a new file named `customer_segments.png` in the same directory, which contains the visualization of the customer clusters.
